# bamazon-app

This app uses Node to interface with a mySQL database. There is one table called Products in this database. The app can take data from this table and return it or add data to it.

There are two files you can run to interact with the database. The first is the bamazonCustomer.js file which is the customer view. Here you can view and purchase items from the 'store.' If there is insufficient stock, you are alerted and asked to pick something else.

When you run bamazonManager.js, you see the manager view. You can view products for sale, view items with low inventory (less than 5 items), add to inventory, or add a new item to the store. Prompts are user friendly and allow for a good user experience.
